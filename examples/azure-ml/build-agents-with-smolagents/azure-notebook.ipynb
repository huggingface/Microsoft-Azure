    "1. Create the OpenAI client with `smolagents`, connected to the running Azure ML Endpoint via the `smolagents.OpenAIServerModel` (note that `smolagents` also exposes the `smolagents.AzureOpenAIServerModel` but that's the client for using OpenAI via the Azure, not to connect to Azure ML).\n",
    "2. Define the set of tools that the agent will have access to i.e., Python functions with the `smolagents.tool` decorator.\n",
    "3. Create the `smolagents.CodeAgent` leveraging the code-LLM deployed on Azure ML, adding the set tools previously defined, so that the agent can use those when appropiate, using a local executor (not recommended if code to be executed is sensible or unidentified)."
