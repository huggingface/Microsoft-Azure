# Examples

This directory contains some examples on how to use open-source models from the Hugging Face Collection in Azure ML, and how Azure users can benefit and leverage the Hugging Face partnership with Microsoft Azure.

The examples range from standard model deployments to more complex pipelines and dedicated use cases such as agents. If you'd like to see an example in particular or get help from us on a specific Hugging Face use-case on Azure, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/huggingface/Microsoft-Azure/issues/new) detailing your request and we'll do our best to help and get the content published, so that the whole community can benefit from it!

> [!NOTE]
> Examples for Azure AI Foundry will come soon, once the Hugging Face integration lands!
