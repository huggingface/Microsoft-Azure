    "This example showcases how to deploy a Vision Language Model (VLM), i.e., a Large Language Model (LLM) with vision understanding, from the Hugging Face Collection in Azure AI Foundry Hub as an Azure ML Managed Online Endpoint, powered by Hugging Face's Text Generation Inference (TGI). Additionally, this example also showcases how to run inference with both the Azure Python SDK, OpenAI Python SDK, and even how to locally run a Gradio application for chat completion with images.\n",

    "> [!NOTE]\n",
    "> Note that this example will go through the Python SDK / Azure CLI programmatic deployment, if you'd rather prefer using the one-click deployment experience, please check [One-click deployments from the Hugging Face Hub on Azure ML](https://huggingface.co/docs/microsoft-azure/guides/one-click-deployment-azure-ml). But note that when deploying from the Hugging Face Hub, the endpoint + deployment will be created within Azure ML instead of within Azure AI Foundry, whereas this example focuses on Azure AI Foundry Hub deployments (also made available on Azure ML, but not the other way around).\n",

    "TL;DR Text Generation Inference (TGI) is a solution developed by Hugging Face for deploying and serving LLMs and VLMs with high performance text generation. Azure AI Foundry provides a unified platform for enterprise AI operations, model builders, and application development. Azure Machine Learning is a cloud service for accelerating and managing the machine learning (ML) project lifecycle."

    "- **Understand things visually**: Qwen2.5-VL is not only proficient in recognizing common objects such as flowers, birds, fish, and insects, but it is highly capable of analyzing texts, charts, icons, graphics, and layouts within images.\n",
    "- **Being agentic**: Qwen2.5-VL directly plays as a visual agent that can reason and dynamically direct tools, which is capable of computer use and phone use.\n",
    "- **Understanding long videos and capturing events**: Qwen2.5-VL can comprehend videos of over 1 hour, and this time it has a new ability of capturing event by pinpointing the relevant video segments.\n",
    "- **Capable of visual localization in different formats**: Qwen2.5-VL can accurately localize objects in an image by generating bounding boxes or points, and it can provide stable JSON outputs for coordinates and attributes.\n",
    "- **Generating structured outputs**: for data like scans of invoices, forms, tables, etc. Qwen2.5-VL supports structured outputs of their contents, benefiting usages in finance, commerce, etc.\n",
