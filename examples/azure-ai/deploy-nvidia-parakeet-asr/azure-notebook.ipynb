    "This example showcases how to deploy NVIDIA Parakeet for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) from the Hugging Face Collection in Azure AI Foundry Hub as an Azure ML Managed Online Endpoint, powered by Hugging Face's Inference container on top of NVIDIA NeMo. It also covers how to run inference with cURL, requests, OpenAI Python SDK, and even how to locally run a Gradio application for audio transcription from both recordings and files.\n",
    "\n",
    "TL;DR NVIDIA NeMo is a scalable generative AI framework built for researchers and developers working on Large Language Models, Multimodal, and Speech AI (Automatic Speech Recognition and Text-to-Speech). NVIDIA NeMo Parakeet ASR Models attain strong speech recognition accuracy while being efficient for inference. Azure AI Foundry provides a unified platform for enterprise AI operations, model builders, and application development. Azure Machine Learning is a cloud service for accelerating and managing the machine learning (ML) project lifecycle."
