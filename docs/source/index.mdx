Hugging Face collaborates with Microsoft Azure across open science, open source, and cloud, to enable companies to build their own AI with the latest open models from Hugging Face and the latest infrastructure features from Microsoft Azure.

Hugging Face enables new experiences for Microsoft Azure customers, allowing them to deploy models on their Microsoft Azure infrastructure directly from the Hugging Face Hub via one-click deployments in a secure and scalable way, as well as from the Azure Machine Learning Model Catalog, or even programmatically via the Microsoft Azure CLI or the Python SDK.

This collaboration aims to offer developers access to an everyday growing catalog of open-source models from the Hugging Face Hub, using Hugging Face open-source libraries across a broad spectrum of Microsoft Azure services and hardware platforms.

By combining Hugging Face's open-source models, libraries and solutions with Microsoft Azure's scalable and secure cloud services, developers can more easily and affordably incorporate advanced AI capabilities into their applications.
