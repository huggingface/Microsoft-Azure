# Frequent Asked Questions (FAQ)

## What is the difference between Azure ML and the Azure AI Foundry Hub?

Azure Machine Learning is a cloud service for accelerating and managing the machine learning (ML) project lifecycle. ML professionals, data scientists, and engineers can use it in their day-to-day workflows to train and deploy models and manage machine learning operations (MLOps). Whereas, Azure AI Foundry Hub is a resource type that is used in combination with Azure AI Foundry resource type, and is only required for selected use cases. Hub resources provides access to open-source model hosting and fine-tuning capabilities, as well as Azure Machine Learning capabilities, next to capabilities supported by its associated AI Foundry resource.

This being said, the Azure AI Foundry Hub is a resource in combination with Azure AI Foundry, on top of Azure ML, specific for Generative AI use-cases, such as LLMs, VLMs, and so on. Every deployment on the Azure AI Foundry Hub will also show as a deployment within Azure ML, under the same Hub-based project; but when deploying on the Azure AI Foundry Hub, one could also leverage and benefit from the extended Generative AI capabilities that the Azure AI Foundry brings.
